						The maximum level of Photon Arts is 17, having higher power while consuming less PP for some. Higher levels of enemies drop higher level disks, and every max-level Photon Arts can be obtained through Excube Shop Exchange, if it’s available on your server. Otherwise, get them from enemies drop and player stores.
						<br><br>
						Besides, it is possible to customize your Photon Arts into “Type-Zero (T0)” or <span class = "en-n">“Zero”</span> through the 
						terminal inside My Room (Personal Quarter), altering the behavior and modifying the stats.

						<h3><b>Usage Basics</b></h3>
						Despite having that many PAs, Bow Braver gameplay revolves around 6 Photon Arts. When your PP is low, you will fire a charged Normal Attack to recover it while keeping your damage.

						Here are the explanations for all PAs: properties, explanation, and even how to use them. While you are at it, a YouTuber named Blac to Basics has made a short video explaining bow Photon Arts. 
						<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA8AOSE2ox8&lc=UgysXT1qVrFG3cGeNxl4AaABAg.98cKhsIbwjY98dMIwXrcsl" target = "_blank"

						Most of the things there are correct though. The faults are probably on my side because of JP language defiency and being careless during the editing.		
					</p>	
					
					<p class = "w3-justify">
						Also, compared to the Google Doc version (whether you have seen it or not), Frame Data section has been merged into each individual PA, so the list below are the things you should know before proceeding. 
						<ul>
							<li>Because several bow Photon Arts can be charged, they are affected by Bow Charge Bonus skill which reduces their charge time and the PP cost. <span class = "bcb">Those values are in the regular parenthesis formatted with blue text.</span></li>
							<li>
								All bow Photon Arts have two terms coined by me to explain the frames: <b>Firing Animation Frames (FAF) and Charging Animation Frames (CAF)</b>. All frame numbers for each PA are written in equation based on those that.
								<ul>
									<li><b>FAF</b> refers to the animation frames that you character fires the arrows to commit to that attack.</li>
									<li><b>CAF</b> refers to the animation frames required to make that PA becomes "charged", causing them to behave differently, such as doing more damage or do more hits.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Most of the data are taken from JP sWiki, a peek at a certain Bow Braver player's document from long time ago, and my personal findings. They should help for those that are hellbent on math though.</li>

							<p class = "w3-justify">
								This is the most important Photon Arts for Bow Braver, especially against bosses. You damage output sways heavily by this PA alone.
								<br><br>
								Firing a spherical marker and taking a short moment to arm, Banishing Arrow stays on the enemy for 10 seconds, and only one can persist at any given time. If the enemy with it takes any damage that you do, it will start the three-seconds detonation timer, accumulating the damage from the follow-up attacks. The explosion occurs afterward, dealing 50% of the accumulated damage, or 65% if you fired it with Just Attack.
								<br><br>
								There are two important things to remember about Banishing Arrow. The first thing is that the following attacks can trigger the Photon Arts: bow Normal Attacks, other bow Photon Arts, offensive Techniques, Braver’s Snatch Step, MAG’s offensive Photon Blast, and MAG’s Technique-based auto-attack action. The second, only Just Attack Bonus and enemy’s Site Multiplier affect the explosion damage of Banishing Arrow.
								<br><br>
								Adding to the bullshit above, charging the PA increases the projectile speed and explosion radius. Movement key input causes you to slide after firing it as well while giving i-frames.

							<p class = "w3-justify">
								Penetrate Arrow is one of the two main damaging Photon Arts for Bow Braver. As the name suggests, the Photon Arts can go through enemies and it can hit them at least twice.
								<br><br>
								The distance between you and the targeted location often determines whether it can hit at least twice or not. By average, staying 2.5 Step Distance (~8.75 in-game meters) from your enemies will guarantee it. You can also hit humanoid enemies twice with Penetrate Arrow as well. Apart from that, parts of a larger enemy can be hit by the Photon Arts more than twice, such as the arms of Dark Falz Elder, Profound Darkness and Gomorath. Keep in mind that “hitting twice doesn’t always double your damage” due to your firing angle and the appearance of the enemies though.
								<br><br>
								Charging also increases the size of the arrow, letting it hit enemies in a wider area, but can interfere with the multi-hit property. Movement key input causes you to slide after firing it as well while giving i-frames. Note that Penetrate Arrow does not have damage attenuation.

								Unlike other bow Photon Arts, you cannot attack enemies directly with Chase Arrow. Upon using it, you will stock up to three void arrows, snapshotting the damage bonus from Just Attack, but use your current R-ATK for damage calculation.
								<br><br>
								Whenever your other bow Photon Arts, including the subsequent Chase Arrow (itself), or charged offensive Techniques hit an enemy, the attack will be fired automatically. Chase Arrow prioritizes the location that your attacks hit, and can be blocked by the parts of the enemy as well. Be wary of your current PP and position if you wish to use the attack to maintain your damage against them.

								There are many things that you should know about it. Uncharged Torrential Arrow deals four hits of damage and stays for one second, while the charged version deals eight hits and stays over three seconds instead.

							<p class = "w3-justify">
								As desperate as it sounds, you are vulnerable to everything while dashing forward to the targeted enemy, even stopping at any obstacles if hit. Otherwise, Kamikaze Arrow will always launch you horizontally based on your movement input. It also has two-part attacks: the diving scales the damage with your current R-ATK, and the somersault kick scales with your current S-ATK instead.
								<br><br>
								Kamikaze Arrow does not have damage attenuation, but it does have limited travel range. <b>Also, if the rush part of the PA hits lesser enemy, your character will stick to and hard stagger it for a brief moment BEFORE somersaulting back.</b>
								Larger enemies such as bosses will cause your character to somersault immediately after hitting it instead.

					<h1 class="w3-text-green"><b>Attack Range</b></h1>
					<p class = "w3-justify">
						“How far can Bullet Bow attacks and PA can go in PSO2?”. Well, the Internet can’t really answer you that so I’ve decided to do some questionable testing procedure and use my personal experiences to tell you about it. Here’s the Bullet Bow Photon Arts attack range.
					</p>

					<div class = "w3-center">
						<img src="img/pics/pa_attackrange.png" style = "width:75%;">
						<p>
							Estimated Bow Attack Range Chart, Aug. 2019, experimented by Argus.<br>
							It is a visualization of how far you can attack things with the bullet bow.<br>
							You do not need to measure the exact distance before firing! (1 Step = ~3.5 meters.)<br>
						</p>
					</div>	

					<p class = "w3-justify">
						In real fights, you won’t be “stepping” and make a perfect distance judgment. When you see your damage drops, say using Master Shot, it’s either you are too far away or you miss your JA. When you're ~8-9 Steps away from an enemy, you can’t lock on to it.
					</p>

					<p class = "w3-justify">
						As you can see from the above, several Bullet Bow attacks can hit things reliably up to ~18 Steps away from your current position. However, most encounters will have you fighting less than that distance. Adding to that, Bullet Bow effective range usually starts from at least 2 Steps distance away from any enemy.
					</p>
					<ul class = "w3-ul">
						<li>First, it prevents Final Nemesis and Penetrate Arrow projectiles from pointing upward.</li>
						<li>Second, your Master Shot can have more space to fly.</li>
						<li>Third, staying way too close to the enemy occasionally will get yourself killed or interrupted, unless it’s downed.</li>
					</ul>
					<p class = "w3-justify">
						Keeping yourself within 5 steps away from your enemy guarantees that most PA will deal full damage unless it decides to move off-map. Below is a reference using Codotta Idetta and its arena in Trace of Darkness.
					</p>

					<div class = "w3-center">

					</p>
					<ul class = "w3-ul">
						<li>Trit Shooter, T0 or not, is a bit different. It’s too hard to measure the range of fired arrows, but their damage drops after ~8 Steps from the enemy. You would use it at point-blank range, so no one cares.</li>
						<li>Bullet Bow normal attack is somewhat different. 
						You can aim higher to compensate for the arrow drop against very far away enemies, and yes, it can travel very, very far.
						</li>
						<li>Chase Arrow's actual range is infinite. As long as you can set it up, you will be able to hit that enemy no matter where it is.</li>

						<li>1) Cerulean Ballista does not trigger Banishing Arrow and Chase Arrow, but triggers S5:Auxiliary Arrow and interacts with the damage accumulation and the attack of S4:Raising Pursuit.</li>
						<li>2) <b>Both modes require direct Line of Sight toward the target.</b> Otherwise, the CPA will deal NO DAMAGE to them.</li>						
						<li>3) Both modes grant Frontal Guard Frames upon activation (the lightning visual and sounds) similar to how Katana Just Guard functions.
						It is followed by a brief period of invincibility, while also providing Super Armour until your character fires the arrow.
						<span class = "warn">Mistiming the attack can lead to an accidental suicide</span>, and your character are still vulnerable to stun and time-freeze effect!</li>
						<li>4) It is possible to cancel the post-firing animation with Step.</li>
						<li>5) <b>Both modes also push your character back slightly</b> by ~0.8 Step Distance (~2.8 meters), regardless of elevation. Be careful against certain fights.</li>
						<li>6) Any effects apply through JA will work with CPA, such as Etoile’s JA Critical skill. It will not gain any extra damage, following the CPA damage rule.</li>
						<li>7) The JA circle may disappear after finishing CPA animation due to lagging or you didn’t use it initialy with JA.</li>
						<li>8) You can slowly rotate your character during the preparation animation to adjust the firing direction, especially with Scatter mode.</li>
					</ul>		
					
					<p class = "w3-justify">
						Think of the CPA as of the “Final Nemesis 2.0(TM)” that activates faster, more versatile, and can clear most minor enemies in one input. The slight delay after firing it and the learning process can be somewhat annoying, but you will get comfortable with it eventually.  Therefore, keep calm, aim with care, and get creative with it.
