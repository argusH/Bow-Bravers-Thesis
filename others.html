						You should get them somehow, as long as your budget allows you, being available in your respective server, or you have plans to utilize them. All of it can be obtained fairly easily. I can guarantee that they are worth investing in and improve your quality of life.
					</p>
					
					<br>
										
					<p class = "w3-justify">
						<h3><b>1) A Katana</b></h3>
						Any katana will work for moving around with Asagiri-rendan <span class = "en-n">[Morning Mistreaver]</span>, releasing the Katana Gear for extra Critical Strike Chance from Braver Combination, and acting as your backup weapon. Check Ahri’s Guide for her recommendation. Otherwise, reap the benefit of Katana Gear Bonus and turn it into a PP recovery weapon!							
					</p>
					
					<br>
					<p class = "w3-justify">
						<h3><b>2) Buffer Weapons</b></h3>
						Grab
						<span class = "ic-midlarge" id = "inline-img"><img src = "img/equipments/others/eclucio_culte.png"></span>Eclucio Culte 
						to provide your party with Shifta and Deband. 
						Otherwise, grabbing any all-classes Jet Boots that let you use 
						<span class = "ic-midlarge" id = "inline-img"><img src = "img/pa/others/strike_gust.png"></span>Strike Gust is also viable. 
						The weapon action of Strike Gust casts a charged Shifta that persists even after switching weapons.
						<b>Keep in mind that this category may become obsolete due to the existence of Luster subclass and S8:Sky Dance's Boon.</b>
					</p>
					<br>
					<p class = "w3-justify">
						<h3><b>3) Weapon Camo/Skin</b></h3>
						The more it resembles an actual IRL bullet bow, the better you can anticipate your charged Normal Attacks. 
						The good looking one also encourages you to play a bit better! Besides, some bow have very long limbs that can 
						obstruct your view during Over-the-shoulder aiming mode. You don't want that, do you?
					</p>
					<br>
					<p class = "w3-justify">
						<h3><b>4) PP Recovery Weapon</b></h3>					
						Apart from the Gaels weapon lines and Genon Ain, you can convert Atlas Agria Ex, Austere Bougen, and maybe a gunslash or a katana along those series into one.
						Keep your eyes open for the following SSAs or abilities/augments:						
						<ul>
							<li>Spirited Response <span class = "en-n">[Luminous Adaptation]</span> available as S1 and S2.</li>
							<li>Radiating Grace <span class = "en-n">[Luminous Grace]</span> as S3, any variants.</li>
							<li>Phrase Recovery obtained as SAF from certain weapons.</li>
							<li>S4: Radiant Response <span class = "en-n">[Photon V Adaptation]</span></li>
						</ul>						
					</p>
					<br>
					<p class = "w3-justify">
						<h3><b>5) Status Effect Inflictor</b></h3>
						If you aren't aura/gleam users with S8:Rainbow's Decay, this is your alternative.
						Use them against certain bosses to expose its weakness or force them to the down state. Frost weapon series, such as 
						<span class = "ic-midlarge" id = "inline-img"><img src = "img/equipments/others/tohisame.png"></span>Tohisame <span class = "en-n">[Grinding Hail]</span>, or

						These invisible accessories can improve or alter your class mechanics. Some of them also provide minor stats and often enough, directly increase your damage output to a degree. PSO2 allows up to 5 rings. The first two are your Left and Right rings on your hands. <b>The other three, however, are slotted Left rings in your 12-13* units.</b>
						<br><br>
						While there are tons of choices, only a few of them are useful for Bow Braver. However, if there are situations that you can find the rest useful, don’t hesitate to switch them a bit, especially the Left ring. 						
						<br><br>
						Also, <b>most should be at +20 for maximum effect and always get R-ATK <span class = "en-n">[RNG PWR]</span> if applicable.</b> They are added directly to your Character Base Stats. Otherwise, DEX is viable, and any DEF will come in handy. If the ring is added to a unit, however, it loses the stat bonus. If you fancy other options, consider checking the tabs below.

									The arrows of your charged Normal Attacks receive a 150 degree turn-rate and up to a 1-second timing window to follow a target. It only affects your charged normal attack, and makes dealing with high mobility enemies much easier.
									<br><br>
									<b>And, NO. This ring is not bugged.</b> At +1, you get 30 degree turn-rate and less than half a second for the arrow to track any enemy. The difference becomes significant once you have grinded the ring to at least +10, and even better at +20. (75 deg. vs 150 deg. at 1-second tracking window). Regardless of your skill, the ring guarantees your arrows would hit something and recover PP, rather than nothing.

											While most Braver players (including me) would suggest you to make them, <b>it's actually ok to ignore it as long as you know what in heck you are doing with bow and katana.</b> The situations where this Braver-exclusive ring can become completely useless are as followed:
										</p>
										<ul class = "w3-ul">
											<li>	
												You are a katana main, and all you care is abusing Genon Ain with double Cursed Radiance <span class = "en-n">[Lucent Adversity]</span>

											<li>
												In certain engagements (such as mobbing or fighting stationary targets), you are sure that with Katana Combat activated, you can hit enemies 50 times without the boost from the ring. 
											</li>
											<li>
												Using bow to fight against extremely large targets, such as Dark Falz Elder or Gommorrath. Your arrows will hit those giants regardless of your aiming proficiency or reasons behind those shots.

									It causes “Mate” items to heal you up to 20% more and quicken the consuming animation, up to 60% faster. This stacks multiplicatively with Quick Mate. If you use Mates item a lot, or you are going BrEt, it’s a great option.

									It grants Jumping Dodge skill that launches you upward, providing a moment of invincibility on launch and allowing the second jump afterward. The cooldown at grind level 1 is 120 seconds, down to 5 seconds at grind level 20.
									<br><br>
									Compared to regular “double jump” learned at level 40, the main differences are the invincibility frames on launch, the launch speed, input count, and having “moderately higher” jump height.

									It reduces your aggro/hate generation by 67%. This means you have to do damage quicker and higher than the other players to maintain the aggro.									
									<br><br>
									Giving up the aggro to other classes grants them more chances to do the damage or hold the enemy still in exchange for your improved survival, space, and time to think. When you are acquainted with Bow Braver, it’s easy to maneuver around bosses for better firing angles.
									If, for some reasons, you are consistently getting the enemy aggro/hate with Stealth Attack equipped, even with things like Hunter’s Warcry, Gunner’s Showtime or even Victory Shout from Hero, something is probably going very wrong in the raid.

				<div id = "mag">				
					<h1 class="w3-text-green"><b>MAG</b></h1>
					
					<p class = "w3-justify">
						<h3><b>The General Things</b></h3>
						The short answer here is just get the DEX MAG with DEX stat of 200. This is because Braver MAG grants additional S-ATK and R-ATK based on the level of DEX it has. However, if you’ve decided to play other classes, you will lose the stats if Braver is not your subclass.
						<br><br>
						Many ARKS will recommend katana players to go with 200 S-ATK MAG, bow players to go with 200 R-ATK MAG, 
						and hybrid to go with DEX as usual. <b>With all due respect, pick whatever you want</b>, but DEX remains better for Braver regardless. You can always create a new character and tailor your MAG for other classes, or even buy a new one if you want.
						<br><br>	
						As a side note, DEX does decrease the minimum damage taken from enemies attack, but the effect is subtle compared to stacking HP and DEF from units and affixes. While the stat actually improves the damage variance, Braver always deals Critical Strike, so it has become somewhat irrelevant. At least DEX lets you grab higher tiers of equipment faster though.
						<br><br>
						What about raising them? Here's how you do it.						
					</p>

					<table class="w3-table-all w3-striped w3-border">

								<ul>
									<li>Feed your MAG with any R-ATK/RNG weapons, mostly the useless ones that you come across. It will give you both R-ATK/RNG and DEX.</li>
									<li>When the DEX stat is high enough that the next item you feed will increase the level, feed them with 5* rarity furnitures to reduce the DEX stat, while further raising the R-ATK/RNG of your MAG. </li>
									<li>You can also trade Photon Sphere for Food Device / R-ATK (RNG) Mini to speed up the process.</li>
								</ul>
							</td>
							<td style = "padding:16px 16px;">

								</ul>
							</td>
						</tr>
					</table>					
					
					<p class = "w3-justify">
						Don’t worry if you accidentally mix R-ATK/RNG with DEX stats, unless you are playing Katana. You won’t get 200 points in each of the stats though. It’s possible to fix it with MAG Stat Down Device somehow.

						however, should be Vulcan <span class = "en-n">[Rapid Fire]</span></b>. Your MAG will fire at the

						What about the support abilities? It’s pretty much up to you. You can follow my JP MAG setting in the equipment example section, or experiment with them yourselves. They do have cooldowns, along with activation conditions, while some are chance-based as well. The abilities come with various effects such as healing, status effect cleansing, invincibility, stat buff and PP recovery.
						<br><br>
						Most people will just stack HP recovery ones, while some try to balance them or set 
						them up for specific quests such as Endless. Besides, the stat buff seems to be obsolete due to 
						S8:Sky Dance’s Boon <span class = "en-n">[Skydance Support]</span> and Luster Voltage Bonus providing it on-demand.

						As a side note, there’s actually one support ability type that is worth mentioning and people

						<li><b>Photon Drink EX</b> gives +20 PP and, if possible, you may want to be Premium for 2 extra effects: 10% PA Damage and 15% Natural PP Recovery (10% if you are using the regular drink, not the Premium version.) You can roll for PA Damage as non-Premium anyway.</li>

						<p><b>A conversation that never happens.</b></p>

					<p class = "w3-justify">

					Regardless of situation and your PP amount, take Photon Drink w/ PA Damage. The extra 20 PP extends your PA usage, goes well with bow playstyle and grants further bonuses from S4: Radiant Response.				
					<br><br>
					
					Otherwise, check the following priority choices to see whether you can use Shifta drink w/ PP Reduction or not. You must be comfortable with your PP amount and management after taking it though.
						<ul class = "w3-ul">
							<li>Your PP amount is within the range of 250 - 270 PP or higher.</li>

					Random Drink Ex w/ Weak Point Damage is viable if and only if you know that the enemy you are fighting has tons of weak points.
