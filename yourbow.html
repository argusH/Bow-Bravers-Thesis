						Like other weapons, PSO2 offers a plethora of bullet bows for you to choose from. Regardless of the server you are playing, 
						the best bullet bow that you should use will fall into the following <b>priority rules:</b>					
					</p>
					<ul class = "w3-ul">
						<li><b>1) It has the highest rarity, which is 15*.</b> The bows with that rarity have absurd amounts of range attack power, and anything below them either become obsolete, or turn into materials for later uses.</li>
						<li><b>2) It has the slots for S-Class Special Abilities <span class = "en-n">[S-class Augment]</span></b>, 
						which means you can put in a special affix augment that gives you PP Reduction to improve your gameplay, or even more damage!</li>
						<li><b>3) It has favorable Potential Ability.</b> If the weapons are in the same category, you would pick anything that follows 2) first. Otherwise, prioritize the one with more versatile Potential Ability first, follow by damage increase and maybe PP Reduction if possible.</li>
					</ul>

					<p class = "w3-justify">
						I recommend you to check 
						<a href = "https://pso2.arks-visiphone.com/wiki/Simple_Bullet_Bows_List" target = "_blank" class = "link">this link for JP</a> and 
						<a href = "https://pso2na.arks-visiphone.com/wiki/Bows_List" target = "_blank" class = "link">this link for EN</a> to see the information about every bow that PSO2 has in each server, including the stats, requirement, Potential Ability, S-Class Special Abilities/Augment slots available, and the possible drop location. If you have played other MMOS, then your question would be “what is the best bow I can use though?” 
						<b>Let me try to explain by using the chart below.</b>
					</p>
					
					<div class = "w3-center">
						<image src="/img/pics/yourbow_bowlists.png" style = "width:75%;"></image>
						<p><b>The Bullet Bow Upgrade Assistant Chart; March 2021.

						</p>
					</div>

					<p class = "w3-justify">
						Although EN server did introduce various weapon series differently from JP server, you can expect everything in the chart to be available at this point. Sooner or later, you will find yourself using one eventually. 
						Depending on your current playing status in PSO2, you may be using a different bullet bow based on the episode that you start 
						or left. <b>Because we all arrive at EP6, anything that exists before the episode is either obsolete or turned into aux weapon.</b>
						<br><br>
						As such, the chart will probably look like the image below. The magic trick to find out what’s the best weapon is now unnecessary. Besides, you may have to make and use some of them through the course of EP6.

						Apart the mainstream ones, there are other bow following the image below. They are PP Recovery Weapon is considered to be “The Charger”. For the last two, Hard Cross Bullet and Quelle Vesper, they have questionable Potential Abilities that make them atrocious in practice, but again, they serve as a placeholder when you can’t get the better bow.

							There exists a crafting feature called “New Type Weapon Extension”. It lets you refine the lower rarity weapons multiple times to have higher attack stats, up to a certain cap based on the weapon’s category. 
							For bullet bow, there are three bows in spotlight here: 
							the all-class bow 
							<span class = "ic-mid" id = "inline-img"><img src = "/img/equipments/others/lambda_bigglow-v2.png"></span><b>Lambda Bigglow V2</b>, 
							the EN, New-type variant of 
							<span class = "ic-mid" id = "inline-img"><img src = "/img/equipments/others/dalz_varley.png"></span><b>Dalz Varley</b>, and 
							JP, Old-type variant of 
							<span class = "ic-mid" id = "inline-img"><img src = "/img/equipments/others/edel_arrow.png"></span><b>Edel Arrow</b>.
							<br><br>
							Max extended bullet bow will have 2344 R-ATK as a result, almost on par with Nike Arcus that has 2365 R-ATK. Lambda Bigglow V2 becomes popular with non-Braver players wanting a solution to quicken Dark Falz Luther stage with its built-in Penetrating Arrow. The other two have an interesting Potential Ability - default for EN Dalz Varley and selectable “hidden” for JP Edel Arrow - that increases your damage output by 34% at max level during Rapid Fire.							
							<br><br>
							Here's the problem: New-type weapon extension is extremely expensive that you could have used that money for other weapon series or units affixing. These lower rarity weapons are also the prime candidates for Reaper and Slayer affix, stackable for massive amounts of damage multiple against enemies with specific elemental weakness and type.
							<br><br>
							The affixing process can be arduous to make that OP weapon just to absolutely annihilate one type of enemy. 
							While it used to be a viable weapons in the past for a moment, the existence of end-game 15* weapons have proved to be much better,
							offering SSA <span class = "en-n">[SGA]</span> slots with even more bonker Potential Abilities. Oh, we do need some PP Reduction as well, and those older weapons can’t give you that stats.							
							<br><br>
							Therefore, don’t even bother with weapon extension at this point... especially as Braver; whatever your main weapon is.

					<ul class="w3-ul">
						<li>1) Despite fighting against various enemies, 
						<b>Dark Falz/Falzspawn enemies remain your greatest threat. They are weak to Light-based attacks.</b> 
						The higher your Light element value is, the more elemental damage you get, which is added to your damage calculation. The value caps at 50 for those below 13* and 60 for 13* weapons and above. 
						Avoid getting multiple copies for different elements to save cost! Most of your damage comes from weapon attack stats, and elemental damage is a bonus.</li>
						<li>2) Weapons obtained from the exchange shop or the Collection File (usually), will have <b>a grind limit of +30, which is fine for Level 3 Potential Ability.</b> You need to extra copies or farm it until it drops to reach +35 grind limit, which grants you Augment Factors.

									Whenever your PA deals damage to an enemy, your bullet bow fires a “lesser, lighter Chase Arrow” following the attack with a cooldown of 0.35 seconds and the power of 66. The game also treats it as “special Attack”, so several damage multipliers apply while being able to trigger a Banishing Arrow detonation timer. What a convoluted ability!

									Auxiliary Arrow has somewhat questionable interactions with Bow PAs. The effectiveness of Auxiliary Arrows scales with how many hits you can make against the enemy, and how well you can maintain the enhanced version. <b>The table below shows the interaction with a single use of bow PA.</b>	Otherwise, you need to time how long it takes to chain those PAs or performing Banish Combo, then use the interval (or the hit counts if any delay) to find our how many arrows it fires.
