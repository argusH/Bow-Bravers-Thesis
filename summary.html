						<h4>1) What’s Bow Braver?</h4>
						Answer: <b>A 
						<span class = "ic-mid" id = "inline-img"><img src = "/img/icons/classes/braver.png"></span>Braver that primarily uses 
						<span class = "ic-mid" id = "inline-img"><img src = "/img/icons/property/bow.png"></span>bow 
						to deal burst damage, preferably from medium range.</b> 
						Excel against bosses; somewhat struggle against multiple enemies. 
						Demands game knowledge, commitment, 
						and has quite a considerably high skill ceiling.
					</p>
				
					<br>
					<p class = "w3-justify">
						<h4>2) Why split the weapons/guides? Isn’t it the same class?</h4>
						Answer: 
						<span class = "ic-mid" id = "inline-img"><img src = "/img/icons/property/bow.png"></span><b>Bow and 
						<span class = "ic-mid" id = "inline-img"><img src = "/img/icons/property/katana.png"></span>Katana 
						approach to combat, mechanics, setup for equipment, and stat scaling are completely different.</b> The Katana Guide precedes the Bow Guide. Also, you will do fine being proficient with one weapon. Learning both means using considerable resources and dedication, and you are better off spending them on a single weapon.
					</p>
					
					<br>
					<p class= "w3-justify">
						<h4>3) How do I play this class at the basic level?</h4>
						Answer:
						<br>
						<ul>
							<li>Bow Braver revolves around 
								<span class = "ic-mid" id = "inline-img"><img src = "/img/pa/bow/banishing_arrow.png"></span><b>Banishing Arrow</b>;
								placing a marker on an enemy and detonates it a moment later after any damage done. Dubbed as 
								<span class = "ic-mid" id = "inline-img"><img src = "/img/pa/bow/banish_combo.png"></span><b>Banish Combo</b>, you choose which Photon Arts to use, so it fits in the 3-seconds timer.</li>
							<li>Bow Braver shines the most during its signature skill called 
								<span class = "ic-mid" id = "inline-img"><img src = "/img/class-skills/braver/rapid_shoot.png"></span><b>Rapid Shoot</b>,
							massively increasing the damage output and improving PP recovery to offset the PP-thirsty Banish Combo.</li>
							<li>Bow Braver has a myriad of PAs to deal with multiple enemies, but the charging mechanic and its awkwardness make it less effective. 
								<span class = "ic-mid" id = "inline-img"><img src = "/img/pa/bow/penetrate_arrow.png"></span>Penetrate Arrow, 
								<span class = "ic-mid" id = "inline-img"><img src = "/img/pa/bow/master_shot.png"></span>Master Shot, 
								<span class = "ic-mid" id = "inline-img"><img src = "/img/pa/bow/torrential_arrow.png"></span>Torrential Arrow, 
								<span class = "ic-mid" id = "inline-img"><img src = "/img/pa/bow/final_nemesis.png"></span>Final Nemesis, 
								<span class = "ic-mid" id = "inline-img"><img src = "/img/pa/bow/sharp_bomb-t0.png"></span>Sharp Bomb T0, and 
								<span class = "ic-mid" id = "inline-img"><img src = "/img/pa/bow/chase_arrow.png"></span>Chase Arrow, 
								are the most commonly used ones among all bow PAs.</li>
							<li>Bow Braver has access to one of the most devastating, all-purpose Complex Photon Arts in the game: 
								<span class = "ic-mid" id = "inline-img"><img src = "/img/icons/others/cpa.png"></span><b>Cerulean Ballista.</b></li>
							<li>Bow Braver can also use 
								<span class = "ic-mid" id = "inline-img"><img src = "/img/icons/property/katana.png"></span>Katana, but often as a utility weapon.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>4) What are the things that you should try to do or have while playing Bow Braver?</h4>
						Answer:
						You need commitment to constant improvement, and <b>willing to adjust your tactics based on your PP.</b> 
						Also, switch your weapon palette mode to 3-buttons, take your time leveling all base classes to 75 for class bonuses, 
						<b>try to get at least 200 PP for easier time to adjust</b>, and have patience to learn. You are not the first and the last person I know who tries to play bow and throws it away a couple days later… even with CPA exists.

						<h4>5) What subclass should I use?</h4>
						Answer:
						In the EP6 era, 
						<span class = "ic-mid" id = "inline-img"><img src = "/img/icons/classes/etoile.png"></span><b>Etoile is often the “go-to” subclass for Bow Braver. Besides, 
						<span class = "ic-mid" id = "inline-img"><img src = "/img/icons/classes/phantom.png"></span>Phantom and 
						<span class = "ic-mid" id = "inline-img"><img src = "/img/icons/classes/luster.png"></span>Luster also works.</b> 
						<span class = "ic-mid" id = "inline-img"><img src = "/img/icons/classes/hunter.png"></span>Hunter subclass remains relevant due to its defensive skills. 
						<span class = "ic-mid" id = "inline-img"><img src = "/img/icons/classes/ranger.png"></span>Ranger and 
						<span class = "ic-mid" id = "inline-img"><img src = "/img/icons/classes/summoner.png"></span>Summoner sub may seem outdated by today, but they remain viable for some. Regardless, the explanation for all combinations can be found in Subclass section.

						Further reasonings can be found in the guide. They are all in level 100/100 format, and you can always adjust it as needed.

								<li>Go make L/Bullet Bow Homing, R/ C. Strike Shoot, L/Jumping Dodge, and L/Atomizer Lover, getting them up to +20. You equip the first two and slot the rest to your units. The last one is up to you.</li>
								<li>Dex MAG is preferred due to Braver MAG and being easier to raise. Otherwise, use R-ATK MAG for class flexibility.</li>
								<li>Hard to play because of PP? Take Photon Drink w/ PA Damage. Already feel comfortable? Take Shifta Drink w/ PP Cost Reduction.</li>

						<h4>8) Anything else I need to know?</h4>
						Answer:					
						<ul class = "w3-ul">
							<li>1) When it comes to “stacking PP”, one can interpret it in two ways: maximum PP or PP Efficiency (Reduction, Active, and Natural). Having a good amount of it is ok, but getting way too much and becomes quite a diminishing return or not worth your investment. Check the Off-topic section.</li>
							<li>2) <b>Practice, practice, practice, practice, and practice.</b> Watch videos from the pros, try it yourself, learn from your mistakes, keep calm and keep firing! It’s easy to get disheartened.</li>
							<li>3) Continue reading the guide for more insights on everything about Bow Braver. Otherwise, close it and play something else.</li>
