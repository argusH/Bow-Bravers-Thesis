					<span class = "ic-smolmid" id = "inline-img"><img src = "../img/icons/property/katana.png"> bow</b>, 
					
					is one of the many classes you can play in Phantasy Star Online 2. 
					Perceptive, resourceful, swift and opportunistic; a good Braver is a force to be reckoned with, while a great Braver 
					is an epitome of a walking catastrophe - a virtuoso of destruction.
					
					<br><br>
					
					In close range combat, a katana will bring down even the toughest of all. Counters after counters, delivering cuts 
					and slices with visceral speed that rivals other melee classes. In long range combat, a bow is a devastating arsenal 
					only hindered by its user. Gracefully unleashing an endless barrage of photonic projectiles, many ARKS have underestimated 
					the weapon, and have now learned to respect and embrace it.
					
					<br><br>
					
					However, wielding two weapons comes with a massive cost, so most will resort to just one: bow or katana. <b>This guide is 
					the web version of the infamous Google Doc guide named "Bow Braver's Thesis"</b> - fully imported - unveiling and leading you through the
					bullshit world of "Bow Braver"; one section at a time.
					
					<br><br>
					No matter which server you are playing in, the guide should work to a degree. Since it was written specifically for JP server,
					most names that appear in EN/Global Server will have 
					<span class = "en-b">[purple text, bold or regular, with square bracket]</span>
					following it, if possible.
					
					<br><br>
					As the name "Thesis" suggest, this is an unholy, collossal guide, loathed and praised everywhere. I will “assume” that you have a semblance of knowledge about PSO2 already before looking at the things here. 
					You will be seeing me omitting a lot of basic information/knowledge you could have learned from the in-game tutorials, or even use shortened terms everywhere.					
					Apologize for any convenience that awaits you, and forget about those Legal/Copyright stuff. Not like those fucking rules matter these days.
					
					<br><br>
					Looking at the navigation tab, you probably want to hit that X button and switch to different classes. Those who presevere and dedicate
					to see it through will find most, if not all, answers to Bow Braver. You probably get better at playing it with the amount of resources
					lying in front of you, but time will tell whether you are still sane or not. Otherwise, just search "pso2 br 弓" on YouTube and 
					stay away from this abomination.
								
					<br><br>
					What about the Katana guide? 
					<a class = "link"href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rM9GvtWBB0mG9Q1-9ZsDQlTN0RqIn7SzTDjxNjgy4ls/edit" target = "_blank"><b>Dreamslayer Ahri has a comprehensive one made already</b></a>, 
					so check it out just in case you find yourself in a wrong website. Shame on me that I’ve thrown almost everything related to 
					web programming away since a long time ago, aka, being lazy. It may look similar to something you have seen. 
					Also, I may be less active with PSO2 at this point, so whatever I guess?
