				<p class = "w3-justify">
					Notorious for its absurdity and difficulty, yet eventually turning to the most falsely acclaimed “brain-dead” attack rotation, we have the Banishing Arrow Combo. People would dub it as “Banish Combo”, where every bow braver will try his best to put in as many Photon Arts into Banishing Arrow as possible in a timely manner for massive damage output.
					<br><br>
					The property of Banishing Arrow does create a large room of creativity and big-brain plays. However, you will end up being strict with your combo patterns in most fights due to speed and PP problems that ensue.

					<p class = "w3-justify">
						<img src = "/img/pa/bow/banish_combo.png" id = "inline-img"><b>Banish Combo
						is all about deciding what bow Photon Arts should we use to maximize the damage of Banishing Arrow within the three-seconds time frame.</b> We are spending around 45 PP as a “damage investment” to offset the limitations imposed by various bow Photon Arts and improve PP efficiency.
						<br><br>
						For example, one of the most staple yet hand-destroying combo of Bow Braver (shown later), is firing EIGHT Penetrate Arrows in a row and hoping it to hit twice. Although it yields a sickening amount of damage (it does) with proper positioning, it costs a staggering 245 PP to execute even with Bullet Bow Charge Bonus and neglecting any PP Reduction. 
						<br><br>
						Now, the question would be "why should I use it though? 
						Can’t I just use other PA like Million Storm or keep firing Penetrate Arrow? 
						Let’s look at the image below, alogside <span class = "ic-mid" id = "inline-img"><img src = "/img/class-skills/braver/bow_charge_bonus.png"></span><b>Bullet Bow Charge Bonus.</b>

						<image src="/img/pics/thebanish_thereason.png" style = "width:50%;"></image>
					</div>
					
					<p class = "w3-justify">
						A single Banishing Arrow that cost 45 PP can deal an equivalent amount of damage to firing 
						five Penetrate Arrows that would have cost you another 125 PP, in just three seconds. To anyone 
						surprises, you can say that Banishing Arrow functions similar to PP Reduction sources in PSO2!!!
						Shorter combos also enjoy more efficient damage with the PA as well.
						<br><br>
						Being restrained to Banish Combo is the main reason that many despise Bow Braver, even worse with various nerfs to it in the past.
						Various gameplay and gearing problems also stem from this damned PA. <b>Nevertheless, 
						no one can deny the fact that, when learned and used right, Bow Braver’s Banish Combo is one of the strongest, 
						most versatile, and most sustained attack rotations in PSO2.</b>
					</p>
					
					<p class = "w-justify">
						Now, there are a couple more things that you should keep in mind while performing the combo. Only you can answer these questions yourself through observation, experiments, and practice for experiences.
						<ul class = "w3-ul">
							<li>Where do I want the Banishing Arrow to land?</li>
							<li>How much PP do you get back from a single, charged Normal Attack, with and without Rapid Fire?</li>
							<li>Do I have enough PP to spend for this combo right now?</li>
							<li>What Photon Arts should I be using for the combo?</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						A lot of people are making the joke that “my brain is too smol for these complications”,
						but once you learn the geist of it, it’s pretty simple!

					<h1 class="w3-text-green"><b>The Damned Combo</b></h1>
						
					<p class = "w3-justify">
						Anyway, after my extensive testing and watching lots of examples out there, I have come to the conclusion that there are 2 
						common variations of Banish Combo. The name will make you feel a bit cringe, but that’s just me. 
						<b>You will decide whether it is “a good time” to perform the combo.</b> Sometimes, firing several PA + Chase Arrows 
						is sufficient. Sometimes, you just need more…

					<fancy-tabs>
						<button slot="title" selected>The Barrage</button>
						<section>
							<div class = "w3-center">
								<image src="/img/pics/thebanish_barrage.png" style = "width:50%;"></image>
							</div>
							
							<p class = "w3-justify">
								<b>Barrage Banisher, aka "The Long Combo",</b> is often your primary rotations. It's pretty much firing multipler PA, mainly Penetrate Arrow by abusing its piercing property and Master Shot from its improved tracking property. Final Nemesis or Torrential Arrow can be added as well. If you want to conserve PP or abuse PA Step, the charged variant also works.
							</p>
							
							<p class = "w3-justify">
								<span class = "warn">“There’s only 3 seconds to follow up after the first PA hits”</span>. That’s the reason why you can do whatever you want on the first hit for extra damage added to Banishing Arrow, depending on the situation.
								<ul>
									<li>If the enemy is large, such as most EQ bosses, and you are two Steps distance away, Penetrate Arrow is favorable.</li>
									<li>If the enemy is extremely mobile, too far from you or you think that Penetrate Arrow can’t hit at least twice, Master Shot would be better; both mathematically and in practice.</li>
									<li>Torrential Arrow and Final Nemesis addition work better if the boss stays still and you are quick enough to set it up. Special mention on Torrential Arrow that you can fire 3-4 of it in advance and use Banishing Arrow's slide movement to close in for the spams.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							
							<p class = "w3-justify">
								Moreover, Master Shot and Penetrate Arrow can be used together, allowing you to kite the boss around while maintaining
								your damage output. With the right conditions, <b>the “Double-hit, Penetrate Arrow Only” 
								variant remains the fastest to execute and gives the highest damage of all.</b>
								<br><br>
								There are two downsides to this combo. First, it consumes fuck tons of PP, especially the “Penetrate Arrow Only”, requiring you to have 200-250 PP, even with Bow Charge Bonus. Second, adding Final Nemesis and Torrential Arrow will delay the subsequent combos. You may break the later combos just for that big damage if you don’t time it well.								
							</p>

						<button slot="title">The Precision</button>
						<section>
							<div class = "w3-center">
								<image src="/img/pics/thebanish_precision.png" style = "width:50%;"></image>
							</div>

							<p class = "w3-justify">
								<b>Precision Banisher, aka "The Short Combo"</b>, is the situational rotation. You are now firing less PAs compared to Barrage Banisher, usually by aiming everything yourself. It is used when you need to be efficient with PP usage during Rapid Shoot downtime or otherwise.
							</p>

							<p class = "w3-justify">
								Take notes when doing the combo.
								<ul>
									<li>If you use the double Sharp Bomb T0 at close range, there’s enough time to sneak in additional Master Shot for extra damage. If you are further away, you can follow up with Chase Arrows to continue the attack.</li>
									<li>Sharp Bomb T0 into Final Nemesis is a very damage-efficient combo but requires proper timing to do so. It can delete lower level bosses.</li>
									<li>Trit Shooter lasts for the entire duration of Banishing Arrow, so don’t expect to follow up with anything.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>							
						
							<p class = "w3-justify">
								The only downside for this combo variation is that <b>you may have to manually aimb them</b> and position yourself correctly to make it work. Sometimes, you just can’t do Barrage Banisher all day long as Rapid Shoot downtime or the boss movement is just too annoying to keep locking on to them. Be split seconds slower, whiffing that PA or not standing at a correct place will ruin everything.

							An extension of Barrage Banisher. If you have been playing PSO2 for a long time, whether as Bow Braver or other classes, you should have heard something along this line:

								</table>								
							</div>
						
							<p class = "w3-justify">
								<b>YES, it is indeed possible.</b> I did take some time recheck some numbers and testing some info out there. After a first PA hit - Penetrate Arrow or Master Shot - and triggers Banishing Arrow, you have less than 180 Frames available to fire 8 more of either. While the frame math looks promising, we have to account the travel speed of those PA and human errors as well, so it's not really feasible in real fight even with good practice.
								<br><br>
								I get it that striving for damage is something we want, but there're some catches here.
								<ul>
									<li>Adding more PA means more PP required. Using either PA, you are looking at the combo cost of 270 PP and 225 PP, even with the flat reduction from 
										<span class = "ic-mid" id = "inline-img"><img src = "/img/class-skills/braver/bow_charge_bonus.png"></span>Bullet Bow Charge Bonus.</li>	
									<li><b>It requires near-perfect timing</b>, meaning that you must fire the PA almost instantly when the JA circle appears to save frames.</li>	
									<li>Pressing 10 PAs in a row is extremely exhausting. You are better off adding Chase Arrow, limit it to 8 or 9 PAs, or charge the first one.</li>

							<p class = "w3-justify">
								Comparing the damage output, squeezing the ninth PA means we are doing 12.5% more than the typical eight-PAs combo. However, if we are comparing it through “potency per PP spent”, it’s 2.5% higher. The numbers are there, but what about it though?
								<br><br>
								It’s something you can do, and I advise against it. Remember, the extra PP that you invest in a single combo can impact
								your PP economy and the next combo you are planning. You may have to waste extra seconds to fully recover the PP cost, 
								or run out of it in a very bad situation. <span class = "warn">All in all, it can induce carpal tunnel syndrome,

						Keep the following in mind when perfoming Banish Combo. Mst can get away without knowing it at all and learn or getting used to Banish Combo by just playing the class. 
					</p>	
					
					<ul class = "w3-ul">
						<li><b>1) Banish Combo always takes at least 5 seconds to complete.</b></li>
						<li>2) Always JA Banishing Arrow. It will take 65% of the damage you have dealt in 3 seconds instead, so it’s at least ~1.54 million points of damage to cap.</li>
						<li>3) It’s easy to get tunneled vision when doing the combo. It doesn’t always end with Penetrate Arrows spam.</li>
						<li>
							4) The time limitation imposed by Rapid Shoot and Banish Arrow can really put you off. 
							Introducing the <b>“Combo Rhythm”</b>: how many charged Normal Attacks you need to cover the PP cost of the combo. 
							There are Multi-charge, Single-charge, and Zero-charge. The image below should show you how it goes for a common Banish Combo.
							<div class = "w3-center" style = "padding: 16px 16px;">
								<image src="/img/pics/thebanish_comborhythm.png" style = "width:50%;"></image>
								<p><b>You got less than 60 seconds during Rapid Shoot. It will add up.</b></p>
							</div>
							Every time you fire a charge Normal Attack, you are trading at least 1 seconds of Rapid Shoot to recover PP. No matter how much you try to Zero-charge it, you will have to do Single-charge or Multi-charge eventually. The amount of damage given by the Rapid Shoot is so high that you can notice the damage drop when performing the combo outside it.
							<br><br>
							<b>Therefore, try to minimize Multi-charge by alternating your combo, practice so you know how different combos can be chained together, and improve your PP Efficiency some more to the point that it feels comfortable.</b>
