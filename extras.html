Let’s say that the (long) description is in English, packed with some tips and memes. Don’t expect a regular drop of contents though, and I've become a Hybrid Braver at this point. Wow, what a waste! Therefore, expect the worst.

						You can also drop by these extra YouTube channels to see the “real gameplay” of pure Katana and Bow Braver. They are EXCEPTIONAL at their executions, and you probably learn a whole lot more than this guide!

						Sometimes, learning only about Bravers is not enough for you to improve yourself. Apart from practicing, I think you can check the following resources to know more about some obscure mechanics of PSO2, and maybe understand more how different classes operate. One day when you join a party in any MPA, you can adjust accordingly and be effective for them.

						<li>
							<a href = "https://pso2.swiki.jp/" target = "_blank" class = "link">PSO2 JP Wiki</a>
							<br><br>
							The “OG SWiki” where most players take the information from. It has everything you want to know about PSO2. Be prepared to use the Google Translate function while you are exploring the materials within.

							<br><br>

							Dubbed as “Makapo”, the diligent JP PSO2 blogger who always catches up with the ongoing in-game trend. Do you want some advice on gear selection, affix combination, merchandises, announcements, and, uh..maybe some general updates/road map? You are looking at one.

							<a href = "https://ranger0.com/" target = "_blank" class = "link">PSO2珍道記</a>
							<br><br>
							Personally, I actually call the website “Ranger0’s Bizarre Adventure of PSO2’s Mathematics”. If you really want some deep dark fantasy calculation for any theory-crafting and further optimization that doesn’t exist in my guide, I suggest you take time reading it.

							<br><br>
							Ballistic warfare always has the right way. I mean, who actually uses bows these days when rifles and launchers can do all the job twice the efficiency? Still, I believe that leaning on the logic of Ranger’s operation can make your arrow as deadly as a lead.

							<br><br>
							The lord of soloing who shows everyone that Partizan can become the true Boss of the Quest when you play it right. As Partizan combat revolves around utilizing Volg Graptor and Partizan Twirl for sustained burst damage, we can always learn something from it.

							<a href = "https://goo.gl/S184Bz" target = "_blank" class = "link">Ryutensei’s Bouncer Guide</a>
							<br><br>
							Flying around the battlefield, kicking and flinging blades to everything; that’s Bouncer in a nutshell. Too bad, Bow Braver can’t fly that well, but maybe understanding about how Bouncer maintains the air superiority and its supportive side can open up some new opportunities.

							<a href = "https://tinyurl.com/y8394coy" target = "_blank" class = "link">Rin’s Gunner Guide</a>
							<br><br>
							Despite having one of the strongest burst damage potentials in the game, the life of a Gunner has its ups and downs when it comes to Chain Trigger rotation management. Why not jump into the stylish world of a shooter and learn some more about them?
						</li>						
						<li>
							<a href = "http://tinyurl.com/yyfvq5v4" target = "_blank" class = "link">Kyo’s DS Fighter Guide</a>
							<br><br>
							A Fighter always lives on the edge of madness, risking its life with Limit Break and pushing forward to decimate everything in its path. To be honest, Fighter isn’t related to us at all, but learning how they operate in close-quarter combat can be useful later on.

							<br><br>
							What if I tell you that the scariest thing in PSO2 is not the player, but his adorkable, death-bringing pets? Those fluffy machines of destruction and the class itself have some cool gimmicks, so it’s never a bad thing to understand what’s going on behind the scene.

							<br><br>
							Support players in MMORPG are like hidden gems in a vast desert. Techer is the backbone of every group content, bringing in enhanced offensive and defensive buff for everyone. Learning more about how the class operates will make you appreciate its selflessness a bit more, and know when to be there when they need you. Just like when you need them!

							<br><br>
							Mages are the instant classics of every MMORPG. Their prowess in mysterious arcane renders enemies in fear at the cost of their fragility. Similar to us Bow Bravers, they will be spamming Techniques hard and fast, and learning how to live with them will surely get you somewhere.
