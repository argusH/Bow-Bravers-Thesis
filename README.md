# Bow Bravers Thesis
 Bow Braver's Thesis but it's a downgraded web version written with (W3) CSS, HTML, JS, and some coding magic. No one has asked for this, I just hate Google Doc for some reasons.
 
 And yes, I ported it myself, literally not following any good web programming guideline and how-to-make-cool-website 101. This feels like a glorified document repo, but it definitely feels better than loading 155 pages of a fucking document of multiple MBs in one go.
