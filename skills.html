									This is an <b>“Active Skill”</b>. Put it on your subpalette and activate it, just like how you use skills in other MMO games. 
									It serves two purposes: <b>faster PP Recovery and temporary damage boost.</b> Firing three arrows means that you gain triple the amount of PP back and learning extra skill related to Rapid Shoot grants you a massive amount of range damage increase.			
									<br><br>
									Remember to use it when it is ready. Otherwise, hold if necessary in certain situations. Rapid Shoot always has around one second activation animation, so you never get the full duration regardless of reasons. If you are flinched during it, you will lose the skill effect. However, switching to any weapons does not deactivate the skill.

									You always start a quest with max level of Gear/Focus. However, there's an unresolved bug that resets the gauge when performing multi-block matching for a quest.

									We ignore the Stance skills during early levels, as Rapid Shoot and Charge Bonus are more vital to bullet bow. Stances become relevant after reaching VH difficulties or higher. The enemies are more resilient, and your attack values from gear can use additional multipliers.									
									<br><br>
									At the current state of the game, regardless of the server, you should go DUAL STANCES. The reason is simple: the opportunity cost while using those stances when fighting enemies with various weak points.
									<ul>
										<li>During Average Stance, every hit you make on enemy weak points deals a minimum of ~17% less damage, compared to Weak Stance.</li>
										<li>During Weak Stance, you may not get any multipliers at all, whether you miss your shots that often or not, or the weak points are extremely difficult to find.</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
	
								<p class = "w3-left">		
									Average Stance keeps your damage multiplier to be at least 1.15x, while Weak Stance will sky-rocket your damage if you manage to hit the enemy weak points consistently. With newer enemies introduced now and then, along with their annoying mechanics, going a single stance may not be enough.
									<br><br>									
									Toggling between both stances requires you to not be locked in any attacks or animation. You can potentially lose a lot of damage by spending too much time switching between the stances.
								</p>
								
								<p class = "w3-justify">		
									“But, what actually counts as weak-points?” Theory wise, you can check JP wiki for that. But, in general and more mundane ways...
									<ul><b>
										<li>Head of most enemies; easier to identify for humanoids one.</li>
										<li>Parts that can be locked on are often weak points, breakable or not.</li>
										<li>Any parts or areas on the bosses that are colored-coded (commonly in red/blue) or structured so clear that you can recognize immediately.</li>
									</b></ul>
								</p>		
	
								<p class = "w3-left">		
									Apart from above, you can do trial and error with Stances. If you deal less damage than you usually do with Weak Stance, that location on the enemy should not be a weak point. Otherwise, try watching different Bow Braver gameplay videos to see how other players approach it, or hit up the JP sWiki for the exact numbers on site multipliers.

						The following skill trees will be the most common forms of many, many, many, many variations that people would tell you. 
						The class often requires 104-108 points to get everything we need, so feel free to adjust the tree as needed. Following the explanation above, it would look like these.

								For this version, we ignore most of the Katana skills. The decision on taking Snatch Step is on you because it can interfere with your Banishing Arrow from time to time. You have the freedom to spend the remaining points.
								<br><br>
								Also, one can remove a point from Quick Mate and opt for the left ring, then spend the last seven points to get Combat Escape. There are times that will find 20-seconds invincibility useful though.

								The last 10 points are left for the player to decide. Feel free to put those points into whatever skills you need, so it works with your playstyle. Some common examples are:
								<ul>
									<li>Max out Combat Finish, especially for those that want to play katana.</li>
									<li>Grab Quick Mate for faster -mate items usage</li>
									<li>Spend at least one point in each Stance Critical skills. If you want to put more into it, check your subclass before doing so. While BrPh and BrEt can get by with level 1 skills, BrHu and BrLu may need more.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>		

							<p class = "w3-left">
								As long as you can cap Critical Strike Chance without having to invest that much in Stance Critical, you should be able to take all weapon necessary skills and still have points left. It’s a different story if you want to take the stats increase ones, and the same concept even applies to BrRa and BrSu.
