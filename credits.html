					Credits due where it dues! Anyway, I must apologize if the guide is insubstantial for some of you, the size compared to others, not being there to answer things in most chat channels, and under-perform compared to the Braver pros out there. Information related to Bow Braver is somewhat scarce, and creating this damn site can be taxing. Regardless, it probably works in the end, but at what cost? I may stop updating it one day, and probably move on to something else...

						Go play the game and, uh, enjoy your life, would you?<br>
						Even in the darkest hours, the light from your bow shines bright.<br>
						But the bow that is “you”, shines the brightest.<br><br>
						
						So... never stop fighting.
