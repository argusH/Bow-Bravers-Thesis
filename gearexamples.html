					I will try my best to show you an example of equipment, combining the examples from both servers. For a JP server, consider it as one alternative you can do, but you always have better options as various items and better affixes become more accessible.

					<b>Due to the arrival of EP6 and my acquaintances' questions, I have now decided to stick to the JP server. All things related to the EN server will come to a stop at the end of EP5. Thanks for having me over there. EP1 - EP4 gear examples are excluded since they are being severely outdated.</b>

					<h2>EP5 (EN)</h2>
					<p class = "w3-justify">
						I wasn’t that active during the EP5 era in the EN server. However, thanks to the generosity of the people behind the game, I finally have some gears to work my way around. Atlas Agria Ex with ghetto affixes, 5 slots Trailblaze and Cleasis units, and Fornis Reng (thanks, my JP friends) were enough for me.
						<br><br>
						The palette setup and MAG setting aren’t that important here. As long as you find your preference and you have level 200 DEX MAG, it’s definitely fine.

						My current main character, Arnia, is going with the hybrid set up: the Cras arsenals & auxes. You can do better than this, trust me. It’s not that good, lmao. Note that the unit affixes value also count Time Ability Bonus. Do subtract around 50-60 points from it for the real value.
