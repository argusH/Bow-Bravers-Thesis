						These classes offer useful tools and skills that enhance your gameplay, either reinforcing the strength of Bow Braver or fixing its problem. Hunter, Ranger, and Summoner subclasses will help you learn the different styles of Bow Braver while being relevant later on. For Phantom and Etoile, consider them to be a direct improvement. For Luster, I personally think of it to be the “fusion” of Phantom and Etoile.

								For the defensive options from Hunter, we choose Automate Halfline, Flash Guards, and Massive Hunter for the sake of consistency. 75% chance of cheating death from Iron Will can backfire in various situations, and since we attack things from range, it also counts as a form of defensive measure. However, some can shift the points from Flash Tech Guard and grab both Iron Will (also Never Give Up) and Automate Halfline for maximum safety.

								To make a Luster subclass skill tree, you may need to drop the points from Styles (Formel, Zandi, and Baran) and Lu Weapon Bonuses. We will be sinking tons of points in offensive and utility skills that Luster has, mainly All Attack Bonus Lu, Shifta Gauge Boost and Tech Arts PP High Save.
								<br><br>
								Adding to that, please take all the skills related to Luster Voltage, so we can get the most out of it. We can’t achieve the same accumulation speed as Luster or some other class combinations using Luster as sub. Speaking of the Voltage Bonus skill, It’s necessary to learn Shifta and Deband, preferably level 17, in order for the Voltage to buff you at every 100 points. Otherwise, it won’t activate. You also need to learn Anti, any level, for High Voltage (500+) to cleanse the status effect from your character. While in that state, you are also immune to most status effects except Stun.
								<br><br>
								Various skills are left behind for you to decide whether you want to max it or not. The example skill tree above should work just fine though.

								Even though your Gunslash can do things now, being a secondary or even tertiary weapon, BrLu is probably the worst contender for it. (or even deemed as a cursed “off-meta” option).

								<br><br>
								The “high power” aspect of Gunslash BrLu relies heavily on utilizing Weak <span class = "en-n">[Precision]</span> Stance. 
								If the enemy doesn’t bring one out, then you are in a rough spot. Gunslash can hit real hard, and I can’t deny that. 
								BUT, <b>Braver skill tree caters Bow and Katana,</b> boosting its performance with weapon skills and stance while giving you a small amount of defense.

								<span class = "ic-large" id = "inline-img"><img src = "img/icons/pairs/filu.png"></span><b>FiLu</b> with massive strike-boosting skills and Limit Break <span class = "en-n">[Overload]</span> usage, and the generally accepted 
								<span class = "ic-large" id = "inline-img"><img src = "img/icons/pairs/telu.png"></span><b>TeLu</b> with access to enhanced supportive Techniques alongside the goodies of Luster. Adding to that, Gunslash gameplay is often “striking-oriented”, where most of Gunslash PA works well in close quarter combat, despite some having a split or pure range damage scaling. You will need to learn about their properties to see which PA should be chained together for optimal rotation.
								<br><br>
								Today, both of Braver weapons perform exceptionally for Braver these days, and many video examples out there have proved it. 
								While no one can stop you from using it, do expect Gunslash BrLu to be inferior in practice compared to other options.

								Fighters are famous for their absurd modifiers and stats numbers that significantly boost their damage: the Slayers skills, the TAJA (Tech Art Just Attack) skills, and the stances. Adding to that, it has a bunch of striking damage boosts. However, we whack our enemies with the arrows, not the bow. And, to get the most of Fighter, you are dropping your health to 50% or 25% for max bonuses, getting a good position to enable stances, and cycling Photon Arts. Hope that the lady of luck is on your side while you are surviving in higher difficulty.

								<li>During the early release of Braver, the bullet bow was considered to be a “garbage tier weapon”: awful support skills and ousted by katana.</li>
								<li>Instead of following the typical Banish Combo Rotation and firing arrows, old day bow players were playing “Mage-bow”: using Rapid Shoot to recover PP while slinging Techniques. For example, dumping seven Ilbartas into a Banishing Arrow, follow with Folmegian. It was pretty broken back then, and the PP usage was as high as today’s bow.</li>
								<li>As a result, if I recall the story correctly, it’s the reason for the nerf where Banishing Arrow disappears whenever you switch to a different bow. Also, Compound Technique cooldown was adjusted shortly after.</li>
							</ul>
							
							<p class = "w3-left">
								After a couple changes to the bow skill tree over time and better weapons introduced, the class combination becomes obsolete.

							<p class = "w3-left">
								Dubbed as the game-breaker, BrGu was one of the popular class combinations back in the old days of the PSO2 JP server. The ridiculous multiplier of Chain Finish and its interaction with bow attack rotation were responsible for the harshest adjustment to Bow Braver. Let me explain.
							</p>
							<ul class = "w3-ul">
								<li>Chain Finish used to apply to every class, and a 100-counts Chain Trigger activation will cause your PA in the next three seconds to deal five times the regular damage. (2.0 x 2.5 from Chain Trigger and Chain Finish)</li>
								<li>Banishing Arrow used to take 100% of the damage you have done, along with any modifier applicable to it. So, everything hits 10 times harder. That definitely doesn't sound broken... yeah...</li>
								<li>Combining the two properties above, a platoon of BrGu can obliterate any raid boss in the game. It was a complete mess.</li>
							</ul>
							
							<p class = "w3-left">
							The tactic was effective, yet problematic to the game, which resulted in two adjustments. 
							First, Chain Finish is main-class-exclusive, cutting the multiplier to half for any Gunner-as-subclass usage. 
							Second, Banishing Arrow takes 50% of the damage you have done, has 2.5x PP cost (20 => 50), 
							and takes JA and site multiplier to boost the power.
							<br><br>		
							Still, I cannot deny that Gunner skills do improve Bow Braver gameplay, 
							but our combat range exceeds Gunner’s in most situations. 
							<b>Our Banish Combo can compete with Chain Trigger burst combo to a degree, 
							so playing BrGu is detrimental rather than beneficial.</b>

								It should take a moment for you to realize that you get nothing from the Bouncer skills 
								through a quick observation. It exists to support Dual Blades and Jet Boots combat. 
								Despite being a hybrid weapon class similar to us, Bouncers tend to use both 
								to keep their damage output optimal unless using certain class combinations, 
								while Braver can choose one weapon and do fine. The field skills look promising, 
								but you can use rings instead. The stance is reassuring, but our damage goes to 
								the enemies’ weak point, and we utilize supportive techniques rather than 
								the offensive ones. The MAG skills stack, but it doesn’t give you more range stats.
								<br><br>
								<b>Going BrBo is pretty much torturing your soul, and you will gravely regret many life decisions doing so.</b>

					What can you imply or learn from here?
					</p>	
					
					<ul class = "w3-ul">
						<li>1) Just Attack is so damn important in this game. You will deal significantly less damage NOT performing Just Attack for any attack or PA. First Art JA Addition is actually a free damage boost as long as you pace your PA usage. It is the thing you are doing every now and then. Please, be consistent with it, even going with BrEt.</li>
						<li>2) The Initial setting for the table is the "ideal conditions" that you will find yourself doing so. For example, you can't always expect to hit a full health enemy for Ranger’s First Hit, unless you are fighting it alone and your MAG doesn't screw you first. Therefore, it's a no most of the time.
							<br><br>	
						You can see drastic changes if you tinker with those conditions. I'm not saying that the subclass is just shit from the number viewpoint alone. I'm saying that "you should do your best to get that 'ideal conditions' for max damage output.”</li>
						<li>3) Chargeable PA is very strong by itself and is further enhanced through Stance Charge skill. Despite the damage, you just can't charge every attack. More about that in the Photon Art section.</li>					
					</ul>
					
					<p class = "w3-justify">
					In summary, at this date, I would say the following:

						"Hey, why the heck should I follow the meta thing you (or the general consensus) have made, Argus?", said someone. "Can't I just go XX-Br and play bow? You know, I don't like Braver, and I want to explore things in my way. You and your thesis can't stop me!" 
						<br><br>
						Unfortunately, that was the things of the past, like, 3 episodes ago or so if my memory of friends' story are still intact. Weapon Extension system exist so that you can make some older, low-rarity bow a bit more powerful again. And, of course, the iconic skills of many class only work if set as your main class.
						<br><br>
						It's just that there are TWO skills that, in my opinion, are integral to Bow Braver these days that using XX-Br is considered to be a huge mistake, regardless of your experience with PSO2. <b>Braver Combination carries your Critical Strike Chance and enable dual weapon plays, while Bow Charge Bonus massively improve bow handling that no other classes can match Braver.</b>
