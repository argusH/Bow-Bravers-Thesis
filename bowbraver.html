						This type of Braver uses (bullet) bow as his primary weapon to dish out high burst damage from any range, but mostly from medium range. Instead of having “Gear” or “Guarding” mechanics, the bow revolves around its <b>charging mechanics</b>, which cause most attacks to behave differently.

					Besides, here are two things about Bullet Bow in PSO2 that you should know.
					</p>
					<ul class = "w3-ul">
						<li><b>1) Bullet Bow is one of the highest skill ceiling weapons in the game.</b> You can attack at anything from the angles and range that no other classes can if you know where to do so. There’s a huge difference between a “decent” Bow player and “mediocre” Bow player.</li>
						<li><b>2) Bullet Bow can be a very PP-intensive weapon.</b> Without proper gearing, class skills, and moderate knowledge about the enemies, playing the class will be difficult, let alone competing against the others.</li>
					</ul>

					For the NPCs related to you, Azanami is your Administrator. She will give you lots of Client Orders that can help you get into the weapons. However, her main weapon is a katana. Io, on the other hand, uses a bow and gives you Client Orders that help you improve on timing your JA… and telling you to play the game as a party.

					Apart from the things above, these are the things that you will have to do, whether you are new to PSO2 or not. Some may seem absurd to do or too obvious that you are wondering why. Just DM or ping me through Discord if you are really, really curious about it.
					</p>
					<ul class = "w3-ul">
						<li>1) Regardless of your starting class, don’t forget to level all the base classes (Hunter, Fighter, Ranger, Gunner, Braver, Bouncer, Force, Techer, and Summoner) up to level 75 for Class Bonuses, mainly <b>the +60 HP, +120 R-ATK, +60 DEX, 90 R-DEF, and +10 PP.</b> You also get another +20 PP for reaching level 100 on your main class! (+2 per level; 91 - 100).</li>
						<li><b>2) Switch your PA-Palette from 2-Buttons mode to 3-Buttons mode. NOW.</b></li>
						<li>3) To have an easier time adjusting to Bow Braver, I recommend having at least 200 PP. If you are wondering, a section called “Why 200 PP?” will explain it. Maybe you will understand.</li>
						<li>4) You should start checking YouTube for boss killing videos and any Bow Braver gameplay footage. It will help in the long run.</li>
						<li>5) Don’t strain yourself. Take a break if you can. IRL stuff takes priority.</li>
					</ul>

						In the end, as long as you can do damage while keeping the hits taken low and die less, you have succeeded in playing Bow Braver (at the basic level). When you have become “good”, this guide turns into another Internet archive. Most videos made by Bow Braver pros should have taught you way more than this bullshit thing.
