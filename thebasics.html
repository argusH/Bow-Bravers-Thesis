					While many would say "bow is a pretty boring class" or "this weapon is too easy", the actual mechanics of Bow Braver are a lot deeper than what most would expect. If you have known about all of these, then good, just skip this section.

							<h3><b>[1] Faster PA Usage</b></h3>
							After performing any attacks, a red circle will appear and if you can time your next attack 
							sync to the circle, it deals more damage. It’s called Just Attack 
							<span class = "en-n">[Perfect Attack]</span> and it persists for a moment. 
							<b>Most bow PA can be executed very fast and newer players can’t react to it well enough. Your damage output will be lesser than expected!</b>
							<br><br>
							It’s the same as playing those rhythmic games such as Cytus, Deemo, Osu!, Voez, etc. 
							Just Attack is like “Perfect” note-tapping. Play the game long enough and you will use the PAs 
							at the moment it appears automatically, hence, just attack! There’s no secret to it. 
							Also, if you are having a problem, try using this 
							<a href = "" target = "_blank" class = "link">8-bit</a>
							tune and time your Penetrate Arrow, Master Shot, 
							and Torrential Arrow to the beat. We are firing at around 170-180 bpm,
							so you should get the idea with it.

							<h3><b>[2] Perfect Charge</b></h3>
							Recalling the Frame Data section, only for the chargeable PAs, the attack is charged when you fire it after the blue light has sparked and the sound effect during it has peaked. Look at the GIF for an example.
							<br><br>
							<b>The complete animation is there to help newer bow players.</b> The speed of doing it will increase the more time you spend with the bow. It’s you to decide when to charge. Note that overcharging (holding the PA longer than usual) doesn’t increase your damage.

								<li>3) Natural PP Recovery doesn’t stop while you are holding the charge.</li>
							</ul>
							During Rapid Shoot, you instead recover up to 18 (6 x 3) PP for Normal Attack and 54 (18 x 3) PP for

							<b>If your arrow cannot do damage to any enemy due to its mechanics, you can fire at it just to recover your PP!</b> Some bizarre examples are the immune barrier of several bosses, teleporters, magnetic pillars, and even energy towers in base defense quests.

							Step now grants you ~0.12 seconds of invulnerability on use, which is enough to evade most things in PSO2 if you time it right. You can Step to cancel many PAs and Techniques, too! Check the PA section on which can be canceled. For the techniques, supportive ones like Shifta and Resta are common, and you don’t have to always charge it.

						Bow Bravers often switch between both aiming modes depending on what they are facing, the Photon Arts, and also personal preference. There are various things that you should know though.

						<b>The game will put the “lock-on reticle” to the closest targetable part of the nearest enemy based on your position and only when your character faces the enemy.</b>
						
						<ul class ="w3-ul">
							<li>Hitting the “Tab” key for the mouse and keyboard will lock your camera relative to the target and you can cycle between the lock-on location with it. Your character movement direction is influenced by the lock-on mode as well.</li>

							<li>You can use the knowledge to help while using Final Nemesis or Sharp Bomb T0 <span class = "en-n">[Zero Strike Bomber]</span> for better control and maybe improved accuracy. Otherwise, use it to abuse PA Step while firing Penetrate Arrow, Master Shot, and Banishing Arrow.</li>

						<b>The aiming mode you use also affects Braver’s movement.</b>
						
						<ul class = "w3-ul">
							<li>Lock-on mode causes your Step Kick to plunge your character toward the direction of the locked-on target. Otherwise, it will follow your movement input instead.</li>
